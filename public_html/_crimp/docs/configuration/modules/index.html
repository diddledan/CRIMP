<h1>CRIMP Modules</h1>
<p>CRIMP Modules come in 2 flavours, there are modules built into the CRIMP
engine itself (<a href="modules/BuiltIn">Built In</a>) and there are modules
that are available as plugins. They are all configured in the same way using the
crimp.ini file.</p>
<p>Each module has its own settings and requirements and are detailed within
this section of the documentation by visiting their directory.</p>
<p>To check what modules are available to your CRIMP website, see the
'<a href="../configuration/#CallingModules">Calling Modules</a>' document within
the configuration section or point your browser to
http://your-site/docs/configuration/modules (if the [/docs] section of crimp.ini
is still set as default) or just browse your cgi-bin
(cgi-bin/Crimp/docs/[ModuleName]) for the relevent html file.</p>

<h1>3rd Party Modules</h1>
<p>Modules not included with the latest CRIMP  are installed in the same way
that CRIMP is installed. The documentation and all the files that come with the
module will also be installed.</p>
