<h2>WordLink</h2>
This is a concept idea for a module yet to be developed by the crimp
team.<br>
<br>
WordLink parses the chosen page content and makes links of certain key
words (similar to wiki words).<br>
<br>
Firstly, the module would have to appear directly above whatever module
is being used to grab the page within the config file.<br>
<br>
<h3>example crimp.ini</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [/docs]</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WordLink = [path
to writable text file]</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ContentDirectory =
../cgi-bin/Crimp/docs</span><br>
<br>
Secondly, for users that have minimum knowlege of their website, a text
file should be included to take care of the initial setup.<br>
<br>
<h3>example wordlink.txt (proberly in cgi-bin and set to chmod 755)</h3>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CRIMP =
http://crimp.sourceforge.net</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WordLink =
http://crimp.sourceforge.net/docs/modules/WordLink</span><br>
<br>
Now the crimp.ini file and initial writable text file has been set, any
pages that contain the word CRIMP (within the chosen section of the
crimp.ini) will be replaced with &lt;a
href='http://crimp.sourceforge.net'&gt;CRIMP&lt;/a&gt;<br>
<br>
There are several ways to add words to the list.<br>
1) edit the text file manually<br>
2) let the module do it for you<br>
<br>
To let the module add words to the list, all the user would have to do
is enter the word into a page as follows:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
[[CRIMP|http://crimp.sourceforge.net]]</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [[my
computer|http://my.site.net/my-computer.html]]</span><br>
<br>
any pages containing these terms will then have the link automatically
inserted.<br>
<br>
<h3>Possible problems and solutions</h3>
The initial users page with the WordLink may not be writable and so the
WordLink will always be in the file as written by the user.<br>
WordLink should be able to overcome this by rewriting the text on the
fly and not entering the word twice into the WordLink text file.<br>
<br>
There will be a page slowdown as WordLink has to check every word in
its file against the page that has been grabbed.<br>
I dont think that this will be too noticable on todays servers and if a
user doesnt like the slowdown, then they shouldnt use the module.<br>
