<h1>BreadCrumbs</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In a popular Grimm&rsquo;s fairytale, Hansel and Gretel are taken deep
into
the forest in the hope they will not find their way out. However,
clever Hansel has left a trail of breadcrumbs to show their return
path. While the story inspires the term &ldquo;breadcrumb
navigation&rdquo;, it
also provides a metaphor of Web usage that is much stronger than many
designers realise.</p>
<p>
Strictly speaking &ldquo;breadcrumb navigation&rdquo; is a misnomer
since Hansel's
breadcrumbs were eaten by birds with the result that he and Gretel
remained lost, started snacking on the witch's gingerbread house, and
so on. His earlier attempt with white pebbles was more successful, but
&ldquo;white pebble navigation&rdquo; doesn't have quite the same ring!<br>
</p>

Navigation: There's More to Hansel and Gretel than Meets the Eye</a></p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>If this page is being viewed from within the default CRIMP install on
    your website, you will already see the BreadCrumbs at the top of your
    page but for anyone that has opened this page directly or still doesnt
    know what this module does, then the following shows what is inserted
    into your page:
    <div style="width: 100%;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Location:</span> home - docs - configuration - modules - BreadCrumbs</b></div>
</p>
<p>
    This allows a user to backtrack through your website without the
    need of starting from the begining of your site just to choose an
    alternative route. Documents can also be easily categorised into
    directories allowing users easier access and at any point, they can see
    where they are without looking at the address bar in their browser.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>This module is included within the default CRIMP installation and only
needs to be configured within the crimp.ini configuration file.</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>This module can be used either globally or on a per directory basis.
  The module has 3 settings for where the BreadCrumbs will be inserted,
  these are 'top', 'bottom' and 'both'. The module also needs to be activated after the main page content has
been processed and before the page template is called.
<pre style="width: 100%; background-color: #eeeeee; color: #000;>
BreadCrumbs = [top | bottom | both]
</pre>
</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>For BreadCrumbs to be globally available on your site and at the top of
your pages:
<pre style="width: 100%; background-color: #eeeeee; color: #000;">
#Global options
PluginOrder = ContentDirectory,BreadCrumbs
BreadCrumbs = top
</pre>
</p>
<p>For BreadCrumbs to be on the very top and bottom of the pages within
the /docs directory:
<pre style="width: 100%; background-color: #eeeeee; color: #000;">
[/docs]
PluginOrder = ContentDirectory,FileList,BreadCrumbs
FileList = horizontal
BreadCrumbs = both
ContentDirectory = ../cgi-bin/Crimp/docs
