<h1>File Permissions</h1>
<p>Depending on how CRIMP was installed, it is recomended that you check the file and directory permissions and set them according to your webservers requirements.
The following is an example only, and your requirements may differ. (This scenario
is from the XYZ Network, Daniel &quot;Fremen&quot; Llewellyn's Webhosting provider.
The webserver runs as user <em>apache</em>, group <em>apache</em>. The apache user
is added to every user's primary group, which is unique to that user. Apache then
utilises mod_suexec to run CGI and PHP scripts with the permissions of the owning
user. The static files are served as the apache user and group. This means that
every file inside the public_html and cgi-bin directories must be readable by
the user's primary group. As the apache user is a member of every user's primary
group no permissions need to be assigned for the <em>other</em> security context.)
<ul>
    <li>All folders should have the permissions 750, or [rwxr-x---].</li>
    <li>All files in public_html should be 640, or [rw-r-----].</li>
    <li>All files in cgi-bin should be executable thus 750, or [rwxr-x---].</li>
</ul>
