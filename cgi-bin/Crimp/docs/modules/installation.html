<h1>Module Installation</h1>
This is a Basic guide to installing 3rd party modules for CRIMP.<br>
<br>
CRIMP Modules not included with the default CRIMP install should be
unzipped or untared into your cgi-bin directory. Depending on your web
server or web host, these files and directories should be world
readable unless stated within the modules own documentation.<br>
<h2>Module Packaging</h2>
Modules can be downloaded from 3rd party websites and are usually
packaged in a compressed file. These packages are usually provided in 2
formats, either a <span style="font-weight: bold;">ZIP</span> or a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TARBALL</span>. Download the appropriate
one for your requirements depending on your type of install.
<h2>Installing over FTP</h2>
For this type of install, your downloaded module in either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ZIP</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TARBALL</span> format needs to be extracted
into a temporary directory on your local machine before uploading to
your web server.<br>
<h3>From Windows</h3>
Using your favorite compression utility (example: <a
 href="http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm">Winzip</a>), extract all the
files to a temporary directory and open your FTP client and connect to
your server host (or use windows file manager by typing
'ftp://[username]@[server-host.com]' into the address bar, you will be
prompted for your password.).<br>
Select your extracted Crimp directory and upload it in its entirety
into the remote cgi-bin folder on your server host.<br>
<br>
*<span style="font-style: italic;">please note, connection problems are
not discussed in this document. Please check your firewall settings!</span><br>
<br>
Once the module is uploaded, you can view its documentation from either
your website (
http://[yoursite.com]/docs/modules/[ModuleName]/install.html ) or on
your local windows machine ( [temporary
directory]\Crimp\docs\[ModuleName]\install.html ).<br>
<br>
After checking the file permissions on the uploaded files listed in the
module install.html, you are now ready to configure it for use within
your website.<br>
<h3>From Linux</h3>
Untar the tarball into a temprary directory:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir ~/temp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd ~/temp<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tar -xjpvf&nbsp; [ModuleName].bz2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
# not sure if this is going to create ~/temp/Crimp<br>
<br>
Use your FTP client&nbsp; to upload the Crimp directory into your
cgi-bin.<br>
<br>
Once the module is uploaded, you can view its documentation from either
your website (
http://[yoursite.com]/docs/modules/[ModuleName]/install.html ) or on
your local linux machine ( ~/temp/Crimp/docs/[ModuleName]/install.html
).<br>
<br>
After checking the file permissions on the uploaded files listed in the
module install.html, you are now ready to configure it for use within
your website.<br>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
Once the module is installed into ../cgi-bin/Crimp, the corisponding
docs
will be installed into the appropriate place in ../cgi-bin/Crimp/docs
which is accessable by your website if configured in
../cgi-bin/crimp.ini<br>
<br>
For further configuration of the module, check the module documentation
at http://[yoursite.com]/docs/modules/[ModuleName]/configuration.html.<br>
