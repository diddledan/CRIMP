<h1>Bluerobot-Right<br/>
</h1>
This layout uses essentially the same markup as <a
 href="/examples/templates/bluerobot-left">Bluerobot-lef</a>t,
but with a different stylesheet, title, and content. As is the case
with most layouts in the Reservoir, the order of elements (header,
content, menu) in the HTML source is friendly and accessible to mobile
computers, text-based browsers, and alternative/accessible devices<br/>
<br/>
Original design by <a href="http://bluerobot.com/">bluerobot.com</a>
and adapted for CRIMP by The Crimp Team.<br/>
