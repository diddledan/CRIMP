<h1>FTP Install </h1>
For this type of install, your downloaded module in either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ZIP</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TARBALL</span> format needs to be extracted
into a temporary directory on your local machine before uploading to
your web server.<br />
<h2>From Windows</h2>
Using your favorite compression utility (example: <a
 href="http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm">Winzip</a>), extract all the
files to a temporary directory and open your FTP client and connect to
your server host (or use windows file manager by typing
'ftp://[username]@[server-host.com]' into the address bar, you will be
prompted for your password.).<br />
Select your extracted CRIMP directory and upload it in its entirety
into your remote webserver home directory on your server host.<br />
<br />
*<span style="font-style: italic;">please note, connection problems are
not discussed in this document. Please check your firewall settings!</span><br />
<br />
Once CRIMP is uploaded, you will need to check the <a href="file permissions.html">file permissions</a> on the uploaded files.<br />
<h2>From Linux</h2>
<p>Untar the tarball into a temprary directory:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="10" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#EEEEEE"><pre>mkdir ~/temp
cd ~/temp
tar -xjpvf [ModuleName].tar.bz2</pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Use your FTP client&nbsp; to upload the extracted CRIMP files  into your
  remote webserver home directory.</p>
<p>Once CRIMP is uploaded, you will need to check the <a href="file permissions.html">file permissions</a> on the uploaded files. <br />
