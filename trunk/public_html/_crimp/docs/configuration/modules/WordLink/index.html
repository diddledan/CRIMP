<h2>WordLink</h2>
<p>This is a concept idea for a module yet to be developed by the crimp
team.</p>
<p>
WordLink parses the chosen page content and makes links of certain key
words (similar to wiki words).</p>
<p>Firstly, the module would have to appear directly above whatever module
is being used to grab the page within the config file.</p>

<h3>example crimp.ini</h3>
<pre style="width: 100%; background-color: #eeeeee; color: #000;">
[/docs]
WordLink = [path to writable text file]
ContentDirectory = ../cgi-bin/Crimp/docs
</pre>

<p>Secondly, for users that have minimum knowlege of their website, a text
file should be included to take care of the initial setup.</p>

<h3>example wordlink.txt (probably in 'var' and set to chmod 755)</h3>
<pre style="width: 100%; background-color: #eeeeee; color: #000;">
CRIMP = http://crimp.sourceforge.net
WordLink = http://crimp.sourceforge.net/docs/modules/WordLink
IND-Web = http://www.ind-web.com/
XYZ = http://www.xyz-network.com/
</pre>

<p>Now the crimp.ini file and initial writable text file has been set, any
pages that contain the word CRIMP (within the chosen section of the
crimp.ini) will be have that word replaced with &lt;a
href='http://crimp.sourceforge.net'&gt;CRIMP&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>There are several ways to add words to the list:
<ol>
    <li>Edit the text file manually</li>
    <li>Let the module do it for you</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>To let the module add words to the list, all the user would have to do
is enter the word into a page as follows:
<pre style="width: 100%; background-color: #eeeeee; color: #000;">
[[CRIMP|http://crimp.sourceforge.net]]
[[my computer|http://my.site.net/my-computer.html]]
</pre>
Any pages containing these terms will then have the link automatically
inserted.</p>

<h3>Possible problems and solutions</h3>
<p>The initial users page with the WordLink may not be writable and so the
WordLink will always be in the file as written by the user.
WordLink should be able to overcome this by rewriting the text on the
fly and not entering the word twice into the WordLink text file.</p>
<p>There will be a page slowdown as WordLink has to check every word in
its file against the page that has been grabbed.
I dont think that this will be too noticable on todays servers and if a
user doesnt like the slowdown, then they shouldnt use the module.</p>
