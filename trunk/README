Welcome to CRIMP

Configuration is all done in the cgi-bin/crimp.ini file


MODULES
-------

ContentDatabase
This module must be configured with a database on an accessible server.
You can use any database that perl supports via the DBI module. The most
common database you'll use is mysql. A ContentDatabase provided section
must have certain options in the crimp.ini. The database must have a
'path' field of a textual type, and a 'content' field of a textual type
that can hold all of your page's data. The 'path' field will contain
the relative path (minus any preceeding slashes or dots, eg ./) of the
page you want to display, or 'root' for the base file. The 'root' page
will display (for our example configuration below) for either /db, /db/
or /db/root. The 'content' field must ocntain either pure (x)html or
pure perl code with "#PERL" on the first line with no spaces beforehand.
you cannot mix and match (x)html and perl within the same section. You
CAN, however, use (x)html on one page, and perl code on another.



EXAMPLES
--------

Example of required crimp.ini settings for ContentDatabase module:
  [/db]
  ContentDatabase = on
  DBType = mysql
  DBName = test
  DBTable = test
  DBHost = localhost
  DBUserName = test
  DBUserPass = test



FAQ

Q. the perl code in my database is printed out as is, instead of being
interpreted by CRIMP.

A. make sure that the first line of your page(s) reads "#PERL" with nothing
before it.
