Welcome to CRIMP

Configuration is all done in the cgi-bin/crimp.ini file


MODULES
-------

ContentDatabase
This module must be configured with a database on an accessible server.
You can use any database that perl supports via the DBI module. The most
common database you'll use is mysql. A ContentDatabase provided section
must have certain options in the crimp.ini. The database must have a
'path' field of a textual type, and a 'content' field of a textual type
that can hold all of your page's data. The 'path' field will contain
the relative path (minus any preceeding slashes or dots, eg ./) of the
page you want to display, or 'root' for the base file. The 'root' page
will display (for our example configuration below) for either /db, /db/
or /db/root.

Example of required crimp.ini settings for ContentDatabase module:
  [/db]
  ContentDatabase = on
  DBType = mysql
  DBName = test
  DBTable = test
  DBHost = localhost
  DBUserName = test
  DBUserPass = test
