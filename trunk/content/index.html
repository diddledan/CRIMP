<h2>Introduction</h2>
<div style="text-align: center;"><b style="font-style: italic;">Crimping</b><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> is joining two pieces of metal or other
malleable material by deforming one or both of them to hold the other.
The bend or deformity is called the </span><b

<p>If you have ever wanted to use multiple web applications for one
site, then CRIMP is for you. It joins web content together and gives
you Total configuration at your fingertips!</p>
<p>Create all your web content from ANY source using 1 simple config
file... Merge together your blog, forum and even content from ANYWHERE
and put them into a template of your own creation!</p>
<p>Still limited? Well, you can create what you want from where you
want... use a single page template for your entire site or even have a
different template for different directories.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>How it works</h2>
The CRIMP engine uses a simple config file that calls certain modules
to create content from any source, any where.<br>
<br>
<h2>Modules</h2>
Current CRIMP modules allow you to insert local content or other
websites into a template of your design.<br>
Future modules could enable RSS feeds, samples of live current IRC
conversations and just about anything you can think of, to be inserted
into your site on the fly.<br>
