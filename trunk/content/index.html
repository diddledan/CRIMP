<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to TOTAL control of your
website...</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>If you have ever wanted to use multiple web applications for one
site, then CRIMP is for you. Total configuration at your fingertips!</p>
<p>Create all your web content from ANY source using 1 simple config
file... Merge together your blog, forum and even content from ANYWHERE
and put them into a template of your own creation...</p>
<p>Still limited? Well, you can create what you want from where you
want... use a single page template for your entire site or even have a
different template for different directories.</p>
<h3>How it works</h3>
The CRIMP engine uses a simple config file that calls certain modules
to create content from any thing and any where.<br>
<br>
<h3>Modules</h3>
Current CRIMP modules allow you to insert local content or other
websites into a template of your design.<br>
Future modules could enable RSS feeds, samples of live current IRC
conversations and just about anything you can think of, to be inserted
into your site on the fly.<br>
