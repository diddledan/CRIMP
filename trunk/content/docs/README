This Directory is a place holder for the real docs directory located in ../cgi-bin/Crimp/docs
The crimp.ini file redirects clients browsers to the real docs dir 
but the FileList module does not see it.

The real docs dir is located permanently within ../cgi-bin/Crimp/docs so crimp users have a permanent reference base for installed module documentation.
  
IT IS SAFE TO DELETE THIS DIRECTORY WHEN CREATING YOUR NEW CRIMP WEBSITE
