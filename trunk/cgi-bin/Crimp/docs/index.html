<h1>Introduction to CRIMP</h1>
CRIMP is an engine for any website that allows content to be grabbed
from anywhere and inserted into your site. <br>
Combine your blog, forum and just about anything into your pages with
the easy to use modules. <br>
More advanced users can find documentation here for editing the
configuration files manually or even creating your own modules.<br>
