<h2>Module Installation</h2>
CRIMP Modules not included with the default CRIMP install should be
unzipped or untared into your cgi-bin directory. Depending on your web
server or web host, these files should be world readable.<br>
<br>
Modules are installed into ../cgi-bin/Crimp and the corisponding docs
will be installed into the appropriate place in ../cgi-bin/Crimp/docs
which is accessable by your website if configured in
../cgi-bin/crimp.ini<br>
<br>
For further configuration of the module, check the module documentation.<br>
