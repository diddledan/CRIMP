<h1>Crimp Installation</h1>
This is a Basic guide to installing  CRIMP and assumes that your webserver is configured according to the default layout as shown within the CRIMP <a href="/docs/engine/index.html">requirements</a> documentation.<br>
<br>
The CRIMP  install should be
unzipped or untared into your web server root (your home directory), if your webserver or webhost is set up differently then please read the <a href="/docs/advanced-install.html">advanced installation</a> documentation.<br>
<h2>CRIMP Packaging</h2>
CRIMP is 
packaged in a compressed file and includes basic modules with an example configuration to get you started. These packages are usually provided in 2
formats, either a <span style="font-weight: bold;">ZIP</span> or a <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TARBALL</span>. Download the appropriate
one for your requirements depending on your type of install.
<h2>Installing over FTP</h2>
For this type of install, your downloaded module in either <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ZIP</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TARBALL</span> format needs to be extracted
into a temporary directory on your local machine before uploading to
your web server.<br>
<h3>From Windows</h3>
Using your favorite compression utility (example: <a
 href="http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm">Winzip</a>), extract all the
files to a temporary directory and open your FTP client and connect to
your server host (or use windows file manager by typing
'ftp://[username]@[server-host.com]' into the address bar, you will be
prompted for your password.).<br>
Select your extracted CRIMP directory and upload it in its entirety
into your remote webserver home directory on your server host.<br>
<br>
*<span style="font-style: italic;">please note, connection problems are
not discussed in this document. Please check your firewall settings!</span><br>
<br>
Once CRIMP is uploaded, you will need to check the <a href="#permissions">file permissions</a> on the uploaded files according to the section later within this page.<br>
<h3>From Linux</h3>
Untar the tarball into a temprary directory:<br>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mkdir ~/temp</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd ~/temp</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tar -xjpvf [ModuleName].tar.bz2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # not sure if this is going to create ~/temp/Crimp</pre>
<p><br>
  Use your FTP client&nbsp; to upload the extracted CRIMP files  into your
  remote webserver home directory.</p>
<p>Once CRIMP is uploaded, you will need to check the <a href="#permissions">file permissions</a> on the uploaded files according to the section later within this page.  <br>
</p>
<h2>Installing over SSH</h2>
If you have SSH access to your webserver, then installing CRIMP over
SSH is the prefered method. Windows
users can use a SSH client (Example: <a
 href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/download.html">Putty</a> which includes pscp.exe) and linux users can use their console.<br>
<h3>Upload CRIMP and MD5 sum</h3>
<h4>Windows</h4>
If you have downloaded CRIMP and its MD5 sum onto your local windows
machine, you can use pscp.exe in your command console to upload the
files.<br>
(Start - Run : then type 'cmd' for Windows XP and NT or type 'command'
for Windows 98/98se/ME)<br>
Change to your Putty install directory by typing:<br>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd [path\to\putty]</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pscp [path\to\Crimp-version.tar.bz2] [username]@[server-host.com]:[webserver root]</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pscp [path\to\Crimp-version.tar.bz2.sum] [username]@[server-host.com]:[webserver root]</pre>
<br>
Then open your SSH client and connect to your server host.<br>
<h4>Linux</h4>
If you have downloaded CRIMP and its MD5 sum onto your local linux
machine, you can use scp in your console to upload the
files.<br>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="input">scp [server-host]:~/ ~/[Crimp-version.tar.bz2]</span></pre>
<pre><span class="input"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="input">scp [server-host]:~/ ~/[</span>Crimp-version.tar.bz2.sum<span
 class="input">]</span></pre>
<pre><span class="input"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class="input">ssh [username]@[server-host]<br></span></pre>
<h4>SSH Client<span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></h4>
Once logged into your server host over SSH, you can run the following
commands to install CRIMP:<br>
<br>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd ~/</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # MD5 check the module for consistancy</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; md5sum -c [Crimp-version].tar.bz2.sum</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # If the check returns OK then unpack the tarball</pre>
<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tar -xjpvf [Crimp-version].tar.bz2</pre>
<br>
CRIMP is now installed and ready for <a href="#configuration">configuration</a>.
 <h2><a name="permissions"></a>File Permissions</h2>
 <p>Depending on how CRIMP was installed, it is recomended that you check the file and directory permissions and set them according to your webservers requirements.</p>
 <pre>public_html (directory)

	crimp_assets			world readable

cgi-bin

	index.pl				world readable and executable

		Crimp (directory)
			var (directory)	world readable and writable</pre>
 <h2><a name="configuration"></a>Configuration</h2> 
<p>Once CRIMP is installed into the webserver root, rename the <strong>crimp.ini.example</strong> file as <strong>crimp.ini</strong> which is located in the cgi-bin directory of your install.</p>
 <p>You can now test the installation by pointing your browser to your website URL.</p>
